# Hobo::Helper

Create a mock view layer:

        >>
         class View
           extend HoboRouteHelper
           class << self
             protected_instance_methods.each {|m| public m }

             def params; {} ;end
             def subsite; "" ;end
             def base_url; "" ;end
           end
         end

Useful stuff

        >> def init_mocha; $stubba = Mocha::Central.new; end
        >> def mock; Mocha::Mockery.instance.named_mock 'mock'; end

## `object_url`

Returns a canonical restful URL for a given object. THe Hobo routing is checked and URLs are only returned for routes that exist.

Note that `object_url` doesn't perform "reverse routing". It knows nothing about attractive URLs you may have declared in your routes file.

Something to link to:

        >> init_mocha
        >> class Thing; end
        >> thing = Thing.new
        >> thing.expects(:to_url_path).at_least_once.returns("things/1")

### Simple 'show' URLs

        >> Hobo::Routes.expects(:linkable?).with(Thing, :show, {:subsite => ''}).returns(true)
        >> View.object_url(thing)
        => "/things/1"

Returns nil if Routes says it's not linkable

        >> Hobo::Routes.expects(:linkable?).with(Thing, :show, {:subsite => ''}).returns(false)
        >> View.object_url(thing)
        => nil

A URL to the 'edit' page:

        >> Hobo::Routes.expects(:linkable?).with(Thing, :edit, {:subsite => ''}).returns(true)
        >> View.object_url(thing, :edit)
        => "/things/1/edit"
