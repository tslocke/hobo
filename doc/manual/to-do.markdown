# To Do List

This "chapter" of the Hobo Manual is just here to let you know what needs to come before the manual is considered complete.

Note that this is just a set of reminders - it doesn't reflect the structure that the manual may eventually have.

 - Multi-model forms

 - Miscellaneous model extensions
     
 - The Rapid tag library
 
 - Users and authentication
 
 - Subsites  (but there is a [tutorial](/tutorials/subsite))
 
 - Hobo's Ajax mechanism
 
Have I forgotten anything? (post on [hobousers](http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers/) if I have)
