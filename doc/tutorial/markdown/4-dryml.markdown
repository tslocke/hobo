## DRYML

Without writing any view layer code at all, the POD application is already in a fairly usable state. The entire UI has been derived automatically using information from our models and controllers. Of course, if you're building an important app, one that is going to be used over and over again, there is never going to be a substitute for a carefully considered, hand-crafted UI. This is where DRYML comes in. DRYML keeps development moving forward very rapidly thanks to two key features:

 * The DRY in DRYML (Don't Repeat Yourself) is there for a reason. DRYML makes it painless to keep your view layer extremely well factored. Well factored code is agile code, and in web development this matters as much in your views as anywhere else. Maybe more.
 
 * DRYML has a unique and powerful *paramaterisation* mechanism. All those automatic pages that are *almost but not quite* what you want -- you won't have to throw away any of it. DRYML will allow you to make very specific changes, small or large. Mark-up that you don't want to change will remain.
