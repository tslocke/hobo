=== Release 0.5.2 ===

Misuse of classify changed throughout to camelize. Bugs related to
certain model names fixed as a result.

Added Hobo::LazyHash. If a value is a proc, the proc is called on the
first access of that key, and the result of the proc becomes the
value. These are used in the new controller customisation mechanism.


Hobo Rapid

  New ajax options reset_form and refocus_form for ajax forms. Default
  is true

  toggle: new function like Element.toggle in prototype (Hobo uses the
  css class 'hidden' instead of an inline 'style' attribute.

  In place editing: various fixes related to HTML/URL encoding.

  New option 'fade' to delete button. Pass fade="#false" to supress
  the fade effect.

  <hobo_rapid_javascripts> now takes an attribute tiny_mce. Set to
  true to enable TinyMCE support for html editors.

  <hobo_rapid_javascripts> within the <page> tag now available as
  inner-tag 'rapid_javascripts'. e.g. you can do

    <page rapid_javascripts.tiny_mce="#true">
    
    to enable TinyMCE support.

  Removed helper current_user_in?

  Editors now have a css class added automatically:
  "<class>_<feild>_editor", e.g. "person_name_editor"

  In place editors now wrap the content in a div if the editor will be
  a textarea or an html editor (was a span).

  All the buttons now have automatically added css classes like
  "delete_person_button", "create_person_button".

  create_button now uses any passed field values in the check for
  create permission.

  object form now has a css class added: either the model class name, or
  "new_<class>"

  New tag <remote_method_form> for calling remote methods with parameters, either with a traditional 


Model Extensions

  Fix to HasManyAssociation#new (didn't support parameters)

  Added block queries to has_many associations,
  e.g. post.comments.find { published = 1 }

  MyModel[...] equivalent to MyModel.find(...) (Thanks to Jamis Buck's
  tip on his blog)

  New feature: defined scopes

  Field types set by set_field_type are now inherited

  Model#conditions { ... } generates an sql where clause from a query
  block.

  Fix to #subclass_associations with has_many :through

  Method #changed_fields? to complement #same_fields?. Useful in
  permission methods.


Integration test extensions

  #visits now can now be given http get parameters

  #deletes added: bob.deletes(some_object)

  #calls_method added: bob.calls_method(object, some_method)


General extensions

  #extract_options_from_args! added to Kernel

  Object#is_a? extended to support multiple args:

    if foo.is_a?(Symbol, String)

  _why's metaid added to Object

  Added Hash#map_hash. e.g. a new hash with all values incremented
  by 1:

    my_hash.map_hash {|k, v| v+1}


Controller extensions

  redirect_to can be passed an object, equivalent to
  redirect_to(object_url(x)), e.g.

    redirect_to current_user.adverts


Model controllers

  Removed customisation hooks, create_response,
  invalid_create_response, update_response etc.

  New mechanism for customising actions. 

    def create
      hobo_create ...customisation args...
    end

  web_method, show_method, and publish_collection declarations are now
  inherited.


Helpers

  debug can now be passed multiple values you'd like to inspect

  param_name_for now accepts a string as well as an array for the
  field path, e.g. param_name_for(current_user, "account.name")

Core tags

  object_link automatically adds a css class "<class>_link",
  e.g. "person_link"

  Changed default date formatting to to_s(:long) for dates and times.

  New tag transpose_and_repeat, useful for those tables when you wish
  HTML grouped cells by column instead of by row.

  New tag if_blank


Permission system

  Hobo::Undefined#undefined? renamed to hobo_undefined?

  can_edit? now works better with boolean fields

  can_call_<method>? renamed to <method>_callable_by?
  

DRYML

  Fix: options to inner-tags were leaking through to the HTML output.

  Debug feature -- if the <def> tag has an attribute
  hobo_debug_source, the generated ERB source will be output to
  logger.debug

  Dryml now reports an error if a part name occurs more than once

  Inner tag names can now be generated at runtime, this allows
  e.g. the object_table tag to generate inner-tags on the fly for
  every editor and label:

    <object_table fields.name_editor.update="my_part" />

  Go read that last one again - it's awesome

New rake tasks

  environments.rake defines tasks like dev, prod, testing so you can
  e.g.:

    rake prod db:migrate

    (thanks to err.the_blog IIRC)


=== Release 0.5.1 ===

Fix to model extensions: hobo_user_model generator could not complete
because an attempt to access the database before the table exists was
made.

=== Release 0.5 ===

Tabla theme

  Changed some heading levels to be more logical - e.g. now use H2 and
  H3 inside a panel instead of H1 and H2

  Various CSS tweaks

  <page>

    Upgraded to use inner tags

    No longer imports public/stylesheets/application.css by default -
    can easily be added using inner-tags

  <application_nav> and <application_logo> moved into the theme (were
  in Rapid)

Frontpage generator

  Page templates modified to use <:intro>, <:main> etc


hobo_rapid generator

  --import-tags option will add two tags to application.dryml:

    <taglib src="plugins/hobo/tags/rapid"/>
    <set_theme name="default"/>


Plugin initialisation

  Theme no longer set to default in hobo/init.rb. Instead use
  <set_theme> in application.dryml


Core extentions

  Enumerable#map_with_index


Ajax Mechanism

  Render parameters (http parameters) are passed in as a hash of
  requests with numeric keys rather than an array.
  (e.g. render[1][id]=foo rather than render[][id]=foo

  Hobo.ajaxRequest (javascript) now displays error messages in an
  alert box. (Known issue: seems to show these twice for some reason)

  In-place-editor support extended to allow other parts to be updated at
  the same time.

  Automatic mechanism for updating multiple displays of the same field
  after an in-place-edit

  In-place-editor for html fields will now use TinyMCE if installed
  (integrated with Ajax.InPlaceEditor)

  Select based ajax editor for numbers, suited for small ranges,
  e.g. 1 to 10

  Hobo.removeButton (javascript) now supports updating of other parts
  along with the removal.

  Dom attribute "model_id" renamed to "hobo_model_id"

  Fix to Ajax.InPlaceEditor - no longer removes <p> tags

  before_ajax hook. This method is called immediately before the ajax
  response is performed. A chance for the controller to make extra
  instance variabled available to the part methods.

  If a custom JS function is specified for an ajax update
  (render[...][function]=f), this name is no longer camelised - it is
  called as-is.

  The object (render[...][object]=...) is now allowed to be nil

  In-place-editor fields now reset automatically to a preset message
  when the field is blank (e.g. "click to edit")


Core helpers

  Fix: object_url gives correct urls when the action is a web-method
  (controller-name/id/method-name)

  <show> will wrap the displayed content in a <span> with a
  hobo_model_id. This enables the automatic update of multiple
  displays of a field value after an ajax edit.

  <show> uses the new type-system added to Hobo models. The main
  benefit is that values that don't come directly from AR should
  display without problem, and more types are supported (e.g. float)

  <show> supports a format attribute for numbers:
    <show attr="price" format="%.2f"/>

  <show> will not display password attributes (e.g. in your model
  set_field_type :password => :password)

  New tags <show_belongs_to> and <show_has_many> can be overriden to
  handle the way these relationships are displayed by <show>

  display_name moved into core (was in Rapid, but is needed by <show>)

  display_name uses <show>, so will wrap the name in a span with a
  hobo_model_id

  <repeat> supports an 'else' attribute, used when the collection is
  empty.

  Debug methods abort_with and debug are now helpers so they are
  available from views as well as controllers.


User Authentication

  Username validations are customisable - pass a block to
  set_login_attr and do validations in there. Otherwise default
  validations are used.


Hobo::Controller

  hobo_ajax_reponse will use @this if no page context is passed

  
Module defined tags

  Can provide a predicate as a block, e.g. to have a different nav bar onced logged in.

      def_tag :nav, (proc {logged_in?}) do ...
      def_tag :nav do ...

    The tag with no predicate will always take precedence if no
    predicate is true. If the proc has a single parameter, it is
    passed the options hash.


DRYML

  Changes to taglib cache system. 

  A list of known HTML tags is defined in lib/hobo/static_tags. These
  are available as an array by calling Hobo.static_tags. Any tags
  parsed that are not in here are compiled as method calls. Thus the
  order of tag definitions is no longer as critical, making it easier
  to split large taglibs into multiple files. As a result, tag modules
  no longer need to track defined tags in a module variable.

  XML comments now passed through to the generated HTML.

  <set_theme> tag to set current theme. Was previously a configuration
  variable. This way it is easier to change or disable the theme.

  New feature - inner tags

  <def> now supports alias_current attribute, e.g.

    <def tag="page" alias_current="theme_page">

    This overrides the current <page> definition and makes the old one
    available as <theme_page>

  <tagbody> supports obj= and attr= at the same time, as with regular
  tag calls



Hobo models

  New type system. This is the extended type system that allows you to
  say, e.g. `set_field_type :intro => :html`. Previously this was
  returned as a symbol from MyModel.field_type(:intro). The new system
  uses wrapper types (simple subclasses of String), and modified your
  model to return these. e.g.

    MyModel.find(:first).intro.class => Hobo::HtmlString

    There are similar types for textile, markdown, passwords, and text
    (the text type just denotes a longer string, and is used for the
    'text' sql type).


Hobo model controller

  `show_method` renamed to `show_action`

  New class method `publish_collection`. Any `has_many` collections
  are published automatically. This method allows custom collections,
  i.e. model methods that return arrays, to be published also.

  create action for an STI base-class controller can now be used to
  create subclass instances by passing the 'type' parameter.

  update action enhanced to allow a full Hobo ajax-reponse (i.e. part
  updates) after in-place-edits.

  Controllers can define a `find_for_show` method to provide a custom
  instance finder, e.g. a chance to perform eager loading.

  Association actions now check for permission to view the association
  owner


Model Queries

  <field>_is predicates now work with belongs_to associations.


Hobo Rapid

  rapid.dryml split up into rapid.dryml, rapid_pages.dryml
  rapid_editing.dryml and rapid_navigation.dryml

  New set of tags for creating navigation bars.

  <no_break> tag replaces spaces with &nbsp; in entire content.

  <edit> tag customisation - for form fields (i.e. new records), will
  delegate to one of:

      has_many_field
      belongs_to_field

      string_field
      textarea_field
      password_field
      html_field

      boolean_field

      date_field
      datetime_field

      integer_field
      float_field

    Redfine these to customise forms throughout the app.

    Similarly, editor fields (i.e. ajax fields for existing records)
    use:

      has_many_editor
      belongs_to_editor
      
      string_editor
      textarea_editor
      password_editor
      html_editor

      boolean_editor

      datetime_editor
      date_editor

      integer_editor
      float_editor

    Redefine these to customise ajax editors throughout the app.

    Note has_many_field and has_many_editor are just placeholders,
    they are not implemented.

  <update_button> supports a params attribute, to send extra params
  along with the HTTP PUT.

  <delete_button> now supports part updates and use of
  Hobo.removeButton together. (i.e. you can have the fade effect and
  also have other parts updated)

  <object_form> does not create a hidden field for the STI 'type' field.


New feature - Composite models

Experimental new feature - mapping tags

New feature - Predicate dispatch modules 


=== Release 0.4.3 ===

Front-controller now filters parameter logging so that passwords are
not logged.

Check if a controller is a Hobo model-controller before installing
Hobo routes.

DRYML

  Can now use obj= and attr= on the same tag, so you can e.g.

    <edit obj="#@this" attr="name"/>

  (The alternative, <edit obj="@this.name"> would not work as
  <edit> needs this_field which would be nil)

  Shorthand obj="page" for obj="#@this"

Various fixes and enhancements to the permission system. Things are somewhat
experimental and subject to change!

Core tags/helpers

  `viewable` method filters a collection down to objects that are
  viewable.


Hobo Rapid:

  <new_in_collection_page> now includes belongs_to associations in the
  form.

  Cleanup of form field / editor tags

  <ul_for> and <table_for> now skip non-viewable objects

  Fix: even/odd cycle in table_for and ul_for was broken with nested lists/tables.

  Page navigation enhanced to allow URL query parameters to be
  maintained from page to page.

  <show_collection_page> now only includes a "New Whatever" link if
  the collection is a "simple" has_many collection (no conditions, not
  :through)

  <object_link> now has a view attribute to link to alternate views of
  the object (see below: alternate show pages)

  <object_table>

    Now allows additional rows to be added by giving a tag-body.

    skip_fields attribute to remove fields from the table

  Better support for confirmation dialogues in <delete_button>


Tabla theme:

  Increased width to 800px;

  Small style enhancements


Hobo Module

  Fix to dom_id for objects in an array that is not an AR association
  (e.g. an array returned by find(:all))


Support for alternative "show" pages. E.g. to add a "profile" page to a User, add

    show_method :profile

  To the UsersController and create
  app/views/people/profile.dryml. You also get a named route
  "user_profile" (e.g. you can call user_profile_url(fred) )

  (Using Hobo Rapid you can link to these with <object_link view="profile"/>)

Fix to template lookup for association pages (e.g. posts/12/comments
and posts/12/comments/new)

Support for permission class methods (experimental). If you can define
permission without access to the object state, you can now do so on
the class:

  def self.viewable_by(viewer, field)
    false
  end

  This helps Hobo in places where there is no object. e.g. in deciding
  whether or not to present a "New Whatsit" link

Fix: pagination was broken on index pages with data-filters.


Hobo::ModelController

  Enhanced to allow updating of date and datetime fields. Dates and
  date-times can be provided either as strings (Hobo will use Chronic
  for parsing if it's installed) or hashes with :year, :month, :day
  etc. keys (as used by the select_date helper).

  find_by_data_filter renamed to find_with_data_filter and now does a
  non-filtered find if no filters were given in the request.

  Added count_with_data_filter

  Fixes to checking create permission when the post parameters
  contains related sub-objects.

  Access to the new page is forbidden if the current user does not
  have create permission.


Hobo::Model

  New model queries <field>_starts and <field>_ends

  The <field>_is query will now use an "IS NULL" query if you pass
  nil.

  Added support for counts with queries, e.g:

    User.count { name_starts 't' }

  Calling `new` on a has_many association (e.g. post.comments.new) has
  enhanced behaviour for new records (those not in the db). Hobo will
  try to set up the reciprocal belongs_to association on the created
  object. This is needed by the permission system when testing
  can_create?

  #reverse_reflection will attempt to find the reciprocal belongs_to
  association from a has_many association.


Ajax mechanism

  Fix when using multiple instances of the same part on the same page
  (i.e. when a part_id attribute appears in a loop).

  Fix when the this_field for the part context is an array index.


Chronic fix to handle dates like "11th Jan" (it can handle "Jan 11th"
and "11 Jan" but not "11th Jan")


New feature - Integration testing DSL. Adds an easy to use DSL for
integration tests.

Fix: search page in IE



=== Release 0.4.2 ===

Fix in permission system



=== Release 0.4.1 ===

New feature: "web-methods" -- RPC style actions in model-controllers. Including
support for ajax responses.

New named route "home" to FrontController#index

Hobo Rapid:

  Renamed <object_small> to <object_card>

  Added support for ajax responses to web-methods

  Removed <possessive> (too app specific)

  <object_link> now passes extra options to the generated <a> tag
  (e.g. class, id)

  Extra options to <edit> are now passed on to the delegate.

  Naming of edit controls reworked. <editor> is an ajax editor,
  <form_field> is a non-ajax form field, <edit> chooses automatically
  between the two. Other tags renamed too -
  e.g. <in_place_edit_for_boolean> renamed to
  <boolean_checkbox_editor>

  Support for datetime and date selects in form fields (not editors)

  Added autosubmit option to autocompleters - submits the form as soon
  as an option is selected.

  Added confirm option to ajax_updater (wraps call in a JS confirm
  dialogue)

  More data types supported by <editor> (formerly in_place_edit)

  New tag <belongs_to_editor>. Currently just delegates to
  <belongs_to_menu_editor> but is intended to switch to an
  autocompleter if there are too many options for a menu.

  New css classes create_button, update_button, delete_button added to
  button tags.

  Image attribute for delete_button for <input type="image">
  buttons. Needs implementing on the other buttons (or maybe we should
  be using css styling only!)

  New tag: <remote_method_button>

  <object_form> updated to only add hidden tags for fields that don't
  appear in the form.

hobo_rapid.js

  Fix: in-place-edit controls were displaying the JavaScript source of
  an alert message after a validation error.

  Support for ajax responses to RPC actions.

  Fix in Hobo.ajaxRequest when no `method` option was given.

  Hobo.applyEvents can now be given an element or a DOM ID.

  Hobo.removeButton: changed duration of Fade effect

  Fix in objectElementFor

  Re-enabled applyEvents in Hobo.updateElement


Tabla theme

  Various CSS refinements

  Added account_nav attribute to <page>

  Added class attribute to page - applied to body tag

  Disable account nav if no `login_url` route exists


hobo_user_model generator

  Migration

    Changed `login` column to `username`.

    Changed to use Hobo migration syntax

  Model: Uses new `set_login_attr`


Plugin initialiser (init.rb)

  Fixed problem with ordering of requires

  Eliminated code to load all models at startup (now done on demand in Hobo module)
  This reduces the footprint of Hobo, e.g. for apps that want only DRYML.


ActiveRecord extensions

  Added HasManyAssociation#new_without_appending. Creates a model with
  the correct belongs_to association but doesn't add it to the
  array. Needed for the permission system.

  Added #member_class to HasManyAssociation and
  HasManyThroughAssociation - convenience method for
  proxy_reflection.klass


General Ruby extensions

  Renamed is_in? to in? to conform with ruby-extensions project.

  Added Module#inheriting_attr_accessor. Creates an attribute accessor
  that looks in the superclass if the attribute does not exist on
  self. Should be used on classes (e.g. inside class << self)


User Authentication

  The user model can now override the class-method
  `password_validations` to customise those.

  Virtual fields `password` and `password_confirmation` now declared
  with field type :password. Hobo Rapid will now generate
  password-edit fields for these.

  Column used for the user-name is now declared by the user-model
  class, e.g.

    class User; set_login_attr :email; end

  Extracted acts_as_authenticated controller extensions into
  Hobo::AuthenticationSupport (was in Hobo::Controller)

  Hobo will manage a last_login_at datetime if such a column exists on
  the user model.


Site-wide search

  Added message when no results found

  Remove objects from results that are not viewable by the current_user


Hobo Controller

  Fix: render_tags - hoboParts JavaScript was rendered multiple times

  Ajax mechanism updated to support RPC actions.


Core tags & DRYML helpers

  Fix: per-request cache of current_user was not working

  Fix: can_update? was broken

  Fix: can_view_this? handles non-ActiveRecord objects better

  can_view_this? delegates to can_view if this_parent or this_field
  is null (previously an error).

  Fix: tag_for_object was broken

  <show> supports more field types

  <repeat> now sets the model_id attribute on the repeated element.

  new conditions <unless_blank>, <unless_empty>, <if_can_edit>

  add_classes split into two methods, one that modifies the hash
  (add_classes!) and one that generates a new one (add_classes)

  Made the new object optional on can_update

  Added a style attribute to <human_type> can be any string method,
  e.g. pluralize, downcase etc.


DRYML

  Form fields that appear within a DRYML form context are now tracked,
  so that hidden fields can be automatically added for just those
  fields that do not appear in the form.

  Renamed instance variable to current context to @_this. Was clashing
  with @this page context.

  Fix: this_type was failing to default to this.class when using the
  obj="" attribute

  Renamed method _part_context_js to part_context_js


Model Extensions (hobo_model)

  Renamed set_fields_types to set_field_type

  Added set_search_columns declaration as a shorthand alternative to
  defining class method search_columns. e.g.

    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
      hobo_model
      set_search_columns :content, :notes
    end

  An id_name with the :underscore option no longer returns the name
  with underscores by default. By default you get the name as it is in
  the DB, if you call id_name(true) you get it with underscores
  instead of spaces (e.g. for use in URLs).

  Added Hobo::Model.set_default_order e.g.

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      set_default_order "name"
    end 

    To use: User.find(:all, :order => :default). Default order is used
    by the hobo_model_controller

Model Controller

  Fix: show-collection action (e.g. post/12/comments) now uniquifies
  the collection if the :uniq option was given on the has_many
  declaration.

  hobo_render now allows the template to be looked for in other
  classes (e.g. in app/views/other_class)

  Added web_method declaration for RPC-style actions. e.g.

    class Users < ApplicationController
      web_method :reset_password
      def reset_password
        new_pw = @this.reset_password
        hobo_ajax_response(@this, :password => new_pw)
      end
    end

  show action now calls permission_denied unless the current user can
  view the object.

  Added customisation hooks create_response, update_response,
  destroy_response. And for invalid records: invalid_create_response,
  and invalid_update_response. The default response will only happen
  if these methods don't do a render or a redirect.

  Added before filter to prepare for a web_method

  Template lookup path changed for
  collections. e.g. /posts/12/comments will now fallback on
  app/vews/comments/show_in_collection and /posts/12/comments/12 will
  fallback on app/views/comments/new_in_collection

  index action respects the model's default_order

Model Queries

  Renamed predicate in_association to is_in

  Added predicate not_in

  Added support for model-defined predicates. Any predicate not found
  will be looked up on the model class.

Hobo module

  Removed guest_user attribute

  Hobo.models now loads all model classes on demand the first time it
  is called.

  Removed parentheses from query in find_by_search (SQLite
  compatibility)

  add_routes now adds routes for web methods

  can_create? uses new_without_appending when passed a has_many
  association to check if the user is allowed to create an object in
  that collection.

  can_edit? returns false for polymorphic associations (for now!)

  can_view? can now handle AR classes (can view instances of this
  class?)  and associations (can view items in this association?)

  Added can_call? permission method for web-methods

Added Rakefile with rdoc task
