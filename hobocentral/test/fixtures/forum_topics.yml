    I have a defined tag (we call call it info-icon) that works great in my views, as well as within partials included in my views. However, the partial within the partial within the view ignores the tag and renders it as plain text. For example: 
    
    The Tag: 
    Code:
    
    <def tag="info-icon" attrs="clazz, tooltip"> 
      <img class="#{clazz}" width="16" height="16" src="/images/info_icon.png" title="#{tooltip}."/> 
    </def> 
    
    
    
    We call this tag in three places: in the view, in partial A included in the view, and in partial B included in partial A. This would give you html something like this... 
    
    Code:
    
    <div id="content"> 
      <p this is in the view</p> 
      <img class="icon" width="16" height="16" src="/images/info_icon.png" title="Icon in View."/> 
    
      <div id="partial_a"> 
        <p this is in partial a</p> 
        <img class="icon" width="16" height="16" src="/images/info_icon.png" title="Icon in Partial A."/> 
    
        <div id="partial_b"> 
          <p this is in partial b</p> 
          <info-icon tooltip="&comment" clazz="foo"> 
        </div> 
      </div> 
    
    </div> 
    
    
    Note the <info-icon> tag near the bottom that should have been replaced with an <img> like the others. This worked fine in the last version we were using, and doesn't work in 0.7. Any ideas?

    Hi, please see below. 
    Running one migration after the other without any changes produces the following. 
    I am using Mysql and Hobo 0.7.0 
    No changes at all between the two migrations. 
    Am I doing something obviously wrong? Could not find anything to say it is not supported. Also looking at the tables, precision and scale seem to get appled correctly. 
    
    Hamilton:~/NetBeansProjects/pronto_crm dev$ ./script/generate hobo_migration 
    
    ---------- Up Migration ---------- 
    change_column :item_handlings, :length, :decimal, :scale => 2, :precision => 6, :default => nil 
    
    change_column :items, :sell_price, :decimal, :scale => 2, :precision => 6, :default => nil 
    
    change_column :plays, :name, :string, :null => false, :default => nil 
    ----------------------------------

    Hi Tom, 
    
    This project have all to be a great sucess, however your documentation is very poor and this discourages the new users like me. 
    
    Best Regards!

    hi once again, 
    
    i was wondering how to do the following without producing ugly code. perhaps one of you can give me a hint. 
    
    i want to to add a radiobutton with two options right beside the "login/section" (Log in 
    Sign up - as seen at the beta site) 
    
    the two options represent the two possible states of a db-field in the user table. if someone changes the radiobutton lets say from state a to state b the field in the database should get updated to b & the "<panel>" section (or the complete page) should get rerendered. 
    
    is there an elegant way to do that? 
    
    
    also i haven't figured out how to add custom "tabs" to the layout. 
    
    thanks for taking your time!

    I'm trying to add this: 
    
    Code:
    
      <script type="text/javascript"> 
      tinyMCE.init({ mode: "textareas", editor_selector: "tiny_mce", 
       plugins: 'save', 
       theme_advanced_buttons1 : "bold, italic, separator, " + 
       "bullist, outdent, indent, 
       separator, " + 
       "undo, redo, separator, 
       link, unlink", 
       theme_advanced_buttons2 : "", 
       theme_advanced_buttons3 : "" 
      }); 
    </script> 
    
    to the head section of a page by using default tagbodies. (as a replacement for the defunct <my_param.append>) 
    
    I've not been very successful. 
    
    But how do I do this ?
