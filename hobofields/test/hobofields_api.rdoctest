# HoboFields API

In order for the API examples to run we need a connection to a database. You can ignore this if you're just looking for documentation.
{.hidden}

Our test requires rails:
{.hidden}

    >> require 'rubygems'
    >> require 'active_support'
    >> require 'active_record'
    >> require 'action_controller'
{.hidden}

We need a database connection for this test:
{.hidden}

    >> mysql_adapter = defined?(JRUBY_VERSION) ? 'jdbcmysql' : 'mysql'
    >> mysql_user = 'root'; mysql_password = ''
    >> mysql_login = "-u #{mysql_user} --password='#{mysql_password}'"
    >> mysql_database = "hobofields_doctest"
    >> system "mysqladmin #{mysql_login} --force drop #{mysql_database} 2> /dev/null"
    >> system("mysqladmin #{mysql_login} create #{mysql_database}") or raise "could not create database"
    >> ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(:adapter => mysql_adapter,
                                               :database => mysql_database,
                                               :host => "localhost", 
                                               :username => mysql_user, 
                                               :password => mysql_password)
{.hidden}

Some load path manipulation you shouldn't need:
{.hidden}

    >> $:.unshift File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), '../../hobofields/lib')
    >> $:.unshift File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), '../../hobosupport/lib')
{.hidden}

Require the module we're testing:
{.hidden}

    >> require 'hobosupport'
    >> require 'hobofields'
    >> HoboFields.enable

## Example Models

Let's define some example models that we can use to demonstrate the API. With HoboFields we define the model's fields, with their name and type, directly in the model like so:

        >>
         class Advert < ActiveRecord::Base
           fields do
                 title           :string
                 body            :text
                 contact_address :email_address
           end
         end

(Note: `:email_address` is an example of a "Rich Type" provided by HoboFields -- more on those later)

The migration generator uses this information to create a migration. The following creates and runs the migration so we're ready to go.

        >> up, down = HoboFields::MigrationGenerator.run
        >> ActiveRecord::Migration.class_eval up

We're now ready to start demonstrating the API

## The Basics

The main feature of HoboFields, aside from the migration generator, is the ability to declare rich types for your fields. For example, you can declare that a field is an email address, and the field will be automatically validated for correct email address syntax.

### Field Types

Field values are returned as the type you specify.

        >> a = Advert.new :body => "This is the body"
        >> a.body.class
        => HoboFields::Text

This also works after a round-trip to the database

        >> a.save
        >> b = Advert.find(a.id)
        >> b.body.class
        => HoboFields::Text

HoboFields::Text is a simple subclass of string. It's a "wrapper type", by which we mean you pass the underlying value to the constructor.

        >> t = HoboFields::Text.new("hello")
        => "hello"
        >> t.class
        => HoboFields::Text

If you define your own rich types, they need to support a one argument constructor in the same way.

Although the body of our advert is really just a string, it's very useful that it has a different type. For example, the view layer in Hobo Rapid would use this information to render a `<textarea>` rather than an `<input type='text'>` in an Advert form.


## Names vs. Classes

In the `fields do ... end` block you can give the field-type either as a name (symbol) or a class. For example, we could have said

        body HoboFields::Text

Obviously the symbol form is a nicer:

        body :text

If you provide a class it must define the `COLUMN_TYPE` constant. This instructs the migration generator to create the appropriate underlying database column type. It should be a symbol that is a valid column type in a Rails migration.

        >> HoboFields::Text::COLUMN_TYPE
        => :text

The full set of available symbolic names is

 * `:integer`
 * `:float`
 * `:decimal`
 * `:string`
 * `:text`
 * `:boolean`
 * `:date`
 * `:datetime`
 * `:html`
 * `:textile`
 * `:markdown`
 * `:password`
 * `:email_address`

You can add your own types too. More on that later.


## Model extensions

HoboFields adds a few features to your models.

### `Model.attr_type`

Returns the type (i.e. class) declared for a given field or attribute

        >> Advert.attr_type :title
        => String
        >> Advert.attr_type :body
        => HoboFields::Text

### `Model.column`

A shorthand for accessing column metadata

        >> col = Advert.column :title
        >> col.name
        => "title"
        >> col.klass
        >> String

### `Model.attr_accessor` with types

In your HoboFields models you can also give type information to "virtual fields" (i.e. regular Ruby attributes)

        >>
         class Advert
           attr_accessor :my_attr, :type => :text
         end
        >> a = Advert.new
        >> a.my_attr = "hello"
        >> a.my_attr.class
        => HoboFields::Text


## Field validations

HoboFields gives you some shorthands for declaring some common validations right in the field declaration

### Required fields

The `:required` argument to a field gives a `validates_presence_of`:

        >>
         class Advert
           fields do
             title :string, :required
           end
         end
        >> a = Advert.new
        >> a.valid?
        => false
        >> a.errors.full_messages
        => ["Title can't be blank"]
        >> a.title = "Jimbo"
        >> a.save
        => true


### Unique fields

The `:unique` argument in a field declaration gives `validates_uniqueness_of`:

        >>
         class Advert < ActiveRecord::Base
           fields do
             title :string, :unique
           end
         end
        >> a = Advert.new :title => "Jimbo"
        >> a.valid?
        => false
        >> a.errors.full_messages
        => ["Title has already been taken"]
        >> a.title = "Sambo"
        >> a.save
        => true

Let's get back to the basic Advert class with no validations before we continue:

        >> ActiveSupport::Dependencies.remove_constant "Advert"
        >>
         class Advert < ActiveRecord::Base
           fields do
             title           :string
             body            :text
                  contact_address :email_address
           end
         end


### Type specific validations

Rich types can define there own validations by a `#validate` method. It should return an error message if the value is invalid, otherwise nil. We can call that method directly to show how it works:

        >> a = Advert.new :contact_address => "not really an email address"
        >> a.contact_address.class
        => HoboFields::EmailAddress
        >> a.contact_address.validate
        => "is invalid"

But normally that method would be called for us during validation:

        >> a.valid?
        => false
        >> a.errors.full_messages
        => ["Contact address is invalid"]
        >> a.contact_address = "me@me.com"
        >> a.valid?
        => true

You can add this capability to your own rich types just by defining `#validate`

### Validating virtual fields

You can set the type of a virtual field to a rich type, e.g.

        >>
         class Advert
           attr_accessor :alternative_email, :type => :email_address
         end

By default, virtual fields are not subject to validation.

        >> a = Advert.new :alternative_email => "woot!"
        >> a.valid?
        => true

To have them validated use `validate_virtual_field`:

        >>
         class Advert
           validate_virtual_field :alternative_email
         end
        >> a.valid?
        => false
